You should be familiar with this company’s data from previous sprints. In case you need to refresh your memory about this data you can find a schema for this database [here](https://i0.wp.com/improveandrepeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdvWorksOLTPSchemaVisio.png?ssl=1). The data itself can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?authuser=3&project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m24!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2solist_db!3solist_sellers_dataset!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2solist_db!3sproduct_category_name_translation!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2solist_db!3solist_orders_dataset!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db!3ssalespersonquotahistory!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db&j=bq:US:bquxjob_439ea020_17f990edf1c&page=queryresults).  \n","\n","Please choose one task from the following combinations:\n","1. Executive Leadership and Finance\n","2. Executive Leadership and Sales\n","3. Executive Leadership and Operations\n","4. Executive Leadership and HR\n","\n","You are asked to provide 2 spreadsheets/dashboards, one for each department and do 2 presentations, one for each department. In total, there will be 4 items that will be used to evaluate your graded task.\n","\n","Keep in mind that both presentations and spreadsheets/dashboards should be prepared with your audience in mind. Make sure that you apply what you learned in this sprint and that you can provide not only data but also insights and communicate them.\n","\n","Evaluation criteria for 2 spreadsheets/dashboards are as follows:\n","\n","- Write SQL queries to extract needed data. These queries should be well documented, with indentation and provided as custom queries in dashboard/spreadsheets. Keep in mind to which departments you are presenting your data so you provide them with relevant data.\n","- Remember how spreadsheets/dashboards should be structured and what data should be provided. Make sure you use techniques provided in the materials of this sprint and other sprints not only to analyze data but to communicate your findings clearly.\n","- Remember to have clear labels, good naming conventions and other elements, so the audience who looks at your spreadsheet/dashboard can understand it without your explanations. We will assess the clarity and structure of the dashboard.\n","- Think about possible data literacy levels for each of the 2 departments and how they impact your spreadsheet/dashboard. We will assess if you could adjust your analysis and insights for them.\n","- Think about the next steps. These will be very useful when doing presentations: what are the drawbacks of your analysis, and what further analysis or recommendations do you have? We will assess if you could adjust your analysis and insights for them.\n","\n","\n","For the next step, provide 2 presentations and present them. For each of the 2 presentations, you are limited to 10 minutes of presentation time (so 20 mins total). In case your audience has more questions, this limit may be exceeded, though you should be prepared to go through all the presentations in the time limit. For the presentations, you will be assessed on:\n","- Slide content: What is presented and how much information is on each slide.\n","- Slide appearance: How content is distributed on a slide, animations, charts, tables, size of objects, etc.\n","- Techniques used to hold the audience's attention: Asking questions, storytelling, etc.\n","- Your body language and voice: They should help you and match the message you want to deliver.\n","- Assurance and self-confidence\n","\n","<br> \n","\n","## Sample Questions\n","This time we do not have sample questions as these will depend greatly on the topic and your presentations. This is important: When presenting, you have to understand your presentation yourself and be ready for deeper, or sometimes even “stupid” questions about the topic.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YEKx3a-Oe0_z"}}]}
